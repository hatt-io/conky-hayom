# conky-hayom
A hebcal implementation for Conky

Would you like to use the excellent hebcal (Jewish calendar) in your conky config? Look no further. The script is very simple, and you can configure it to satisfy your particular demands. Please note for example that city (-C) is set to Stockholm, which is not likely your current location. 

You need Hebcal (https://github.com/hebcal/hebcal) for it to work.
